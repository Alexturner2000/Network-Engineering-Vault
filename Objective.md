# Objective

I want to be able to research certain topics that i find incredibly interesting, and I want to organize them in a way that make sense to me; With a **Zettelkasten**.

Categorizing networking topics is hard. There is a lot of overlap between concepts and ideas, and frequently we have to return to the basics to fully comprehend something. For instance, the term "Broadcast" can be used across multiple areas of networking. From layer 2 ARP, to layer 3 OSPF hello propagation, to DHCP, broadcasting can be applicable to more than one protocol. Fundamentally though, what is broadcast? And where else can this concept be applied? Though broadcast is one of the more simplistic and easily to understand topics, its still incredibly important to fully understand the meaning behind it. What are broadcasting limitations? Where are the points of failure? Does it even work in IPv6? Questions like these are trivial to understanding the true idea of broadcast.

**Obsidian** offers a totally non-tradition approach to taking notes. In school, we were always taught to organize ideas by category. Math, Chemistry, Physics, Computer Science etc... But what if I told you, all these topics are interlinked and there are ideas that span across each of these categories. The idea of ethernet --- using 4 pairs of copper cable, to send data at a fixed clock rate, with the environmental factors of attenuation over 100m, or large electrical fields; everything is interconnected. 

Obsidian offers a better approach to understanding these topics, where you can link topics and ideas that span across multiple domains ;) ethernet can be related to PoE, electrical, ohms law, capacitance, attenuation, AC/DC... a million freaking topics! By making these links it makes way for a be

Another really cool part about my obsidian methodology are Tags. While they can link nodes together, it also acts as an aside, to leave room for further elaboration on topics. I may not create a note specific to a tag, however, if i find the need to, I can!
