# Objective
I also want to be able to research certain topics that i find incredibly interest that might or might not encounter on a day-to-day basis. Categorizing networking topics is hard, because there is a lot of overlap between concepts and ideas, and in using obsidian, it may offer a better approach to viuilizing these top. 

Using obsidian, I hope to link these topics and ideas in a way to better understand data networks on a different level.
