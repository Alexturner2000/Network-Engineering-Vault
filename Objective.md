# Objective

I also want to be able to research certain topics that i find incredibly interesting --- Categorizing networking topics is hard, because there is a lot of overlap between concepts and ideas. For example, the term "Broadcast" can be used across multiple areas of networking. From layer 2 ARP, to layer 3 OSPF hello propagation, broadcast can be applicable to more than one protocol.

In using obsidian, it may offer a better approach to visualizing and understanding these topics. I personally find that in many cases, understanding networking concepts is relatively abstract, since they often share common topics that you may or may not understand. Hopefully this vault will help myself understand the importance of certain topics in the field and give me a better understanding at where
