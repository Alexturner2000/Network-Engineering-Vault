# Objective

I want to be able to research certain topics that i find incredibly interesting, and I want to organize them in a way that make sense to me; With a **Zettelkasten**.

Categorizing networking topics is hard. There is a lot of overlap between concepts and ideas, and frequently we have to return to the basics to fully comprehend something. For instance, the term "Broadcast" can be used across multiple areas of networking. From layer 2 ARP, to layer 3 OSPF hello propagation, to DHCP, broadcasting can be applicable to more than one protocol. Fundamentally though, what is broadcast? And where else can this concept be applied? 

Though broadcast is one of the more simplistic and easily to understand topics, its still incredibly important to fully understand the meaning behind it. What are broadcasting limitations? Where are the points of failure? Does it even work in IPv6? Questions like these are trivial to understanding the true idea of broa

In using obsidian, it may offer a better approach to understanding these topics. I personally find that in many cases, understanding networking concepts is relatively abstract, since they often share common topics that you may or may not understand. Hopefully this vault will help myself understand the importance of certain topics in the field and give me a better understanding at where

Another really cool part about my obsidian methodology are Tags. While they can link nodes together, it also acts as an aside, to leave room for further elaboration on topics. I may not create a note specific to a tag, however, if i find the need to, I can!
