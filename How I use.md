# How I Use
At the top of each note, there will be a list of tags to describe the type of note that was taken. This is key Ill create a note with tags and drag it into the **Tags** folder 

I navigate through the notes using the graph view. Everything else is unorganized and sorted in either **Main Notes**, **Tags**, **Work in progress**, and **Misc**.
