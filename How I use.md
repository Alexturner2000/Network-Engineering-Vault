# How I Use
use of [[tags]] will link ideas and notes together. At the top of each note, there will be a list of tags to describe the type of note that was taken.

I navigate between the notes using the graph view. Everything else is unorganized and sorted in either **01 - Main Notes**, **02 - Tags**, **03 - Work in progress**, and **09 - Misc**.
