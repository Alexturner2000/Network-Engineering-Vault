# How I Use
At the top of each note, there will be a list of tags to describe the type of note that was taken. This is key to the functionality of the vault, as adding these tags will link ideas together and will populate the *Graph View*. When a new tag is added, ill create a note with the tag and place it in the tags folder until (and if) I want to expand on the tag 

I navigate through the notes using the graph view. Everything else is unorganized and sorted in either **Main Notes**, **Tags**, **Work in progress**, and **Misc**.
