# Ohms Law
tags: [[Electrical]], [[Math]], [[Current]],

Ohm's law states that the electric current through a conductor between two points is directly proporational to the voltage across the two points. Introducing the constant of proportionality, the resistance [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law). 

V = IR
I = V/R
R = V/I

Where I is the current
Where V is the Voltage
Where R is the Resistance

### Voltage
The electrical potential difference. Its the pressure that pushes the charge through the circuit. How far can one electron jump from valence to valence.

### Current
THe current is the flow of electrical charge through the conductor. Current is like the amount of electrons flowing from one point to the other.

### Resistance
Resistance opposes the flow of electrons. This could be rubber or a resistor.
