## Cable Management
While it might seem pretty common sense to just go out and start zip tying cat5 cables  to make it look beautiful like electricians, there's actually a lot wrong with that. Unlike electrical work, ethernet cables are constantly plugged, unplugged, damaged, moved and removed. If you want to waist plastic quick and cut your hands open, use zip ties. But id recommend saving some time and energy and just grab a strip of **Velcro** to make everything much easier. You'll thank me later

**Labeling**. While it might seem like a waist of time, use small labels for some of the cables you might be moving around. You never know how easy it is to lose a cable in a nest of already dangling cables until you have. Otherwise, knot the end of the cable and pray it holds together

Coming in from multiple sides of the rack saves a significant amount of space and make for adding new gear more easy.

Patch panels directly above and below the switch are freaking amazing. However, life is not always candies and rainbows...
