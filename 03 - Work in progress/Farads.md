Symbol: $F$
Definition: The measure of [[capacitance]]. How much charge a capacitor can store per volt of electrical potential
Basic Equation:
$$C = \epsilon_0 \cdot \epsilon_r \cdot \frac{A}{d}$$
$C$ is [[capacitance]] in *Farads* $F$
$\epsilon_0$ is Permittivity of free space constant ($8.854 \times 10^{-12} F/m$)
$\epsilon_r$ is Relative Permittivity of the material between plates (Dimensionless, air has $\epsilon_r â‰ˆ 1$)
$A$ is the area of one of the plates (in square meters $m^2$)
$d$ is the distance between the plates (in meters, $m$)
