# Joule's Law
tags: [[Electrical]], [[DC]], [[AC]], [[Electromagnetism]], [[Joule Heating]]

## Direct Current (DC)
$$
P = I^2 R
$$

P = I (VA - VB)

- P is the Power (energy pre time) converted from electrical energy to thermal energy
- I is the current travelling through the resistor or other element
- VA - VB is the voltage drop access the element
$$
X_k = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x_ke\pi
$$
## Alternating Current (AC)
$$P = I_{\text{rms}}^2 R$$

P(t) = U(t)I(t)
- t is time
- P is the instantaneous active power being converted from electrical energy to heat

Pavg = UrmsIrms = (Irms)^2R = (Urms)^2/R
 - avg denotes averrge (mean) over one or more cycles
 - rms denotes root mean square

## Differential form
dP/dV = J * E
- J is current density
- E is the electric field
