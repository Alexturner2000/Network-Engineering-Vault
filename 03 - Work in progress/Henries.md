Symbol: $H$
Definition: The measure of inductance, which describes the ability of a coil or conductor to store energy in a magnetic field when current is passed through it. The higher the inductance, the more the current changes are resisted by the magnetic field.

Inductance Calculation in Henries
$$L = \mu_0 ⋅\mu_r ⋅\frac{N^2⋅A}{l}$$
$L$ is inductance in *Siemens*
$\mu_o$ is Permeability of free space constant $4\pi × 10^-7 H/m$
$\mu_r$ is Relative Permeability of the core material ($1$ for air)
$N$ is Coil rotations
$A$ is
$l$ is
