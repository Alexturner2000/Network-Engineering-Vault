Symbol: $H$
Definition: The measure of inductance, which describes the ability of a coil or conductor to store energy in a magnetic field when current is passed through it. The higher the inductance, the more the current changes are resisted by the magnetic field.
$$G = \frac{1}{R}$$
$G$ is conductance in *Siemens*
$R$ is resistance in *Ohms* $\ohm$
