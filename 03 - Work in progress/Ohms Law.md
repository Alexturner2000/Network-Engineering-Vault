# Ohms Law
tags: [[Electrical]], [[Math]], [[Current]],

Ohm's law states that the electric current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points. Introducing the constant of proportionality, the resistance [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law). 

$V = IR$
$I = \frac{V}{R}$
$R = \frac{V}{I}$

Where $I$ is the current
Where $V$ is the Voltage
Where $R$ is the Resistance

### Voltage
The electrical potential difference. Its the pressure that pushes the charge through the circuit. How far can one electron jump from valence to valence.
### Current
The current is the flow of electrical charge through the conductor. Current is like the amount of electrons flowing from one point to the other.
### Resistance
Resistance opposes the flow of electrons. This could be rubber or a resistor.

#### Resistance Units
To find the total resistance of all components, add the reciprocals of R in sum
$$R = (\frac{1}{R1} + \frac{1}{R2} + \frac{1}{R3} + ... + \frac{1}{Rn})^{-1}$$

There are other additional factors that may cause changes to the resistance. [[Joule Heating]] or Ohmic Heating occurs when the temperature of the conductor affects the electric current through a conductor. The calculation is known as [[Joule's law]].
