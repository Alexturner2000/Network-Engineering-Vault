# Attenuation
Tags: [[Attenuation Coefficient]], [[Electrical]], [[PoE]], [[Physics]], [[UTP]]

The reduction in signal strength over a distance
$$ Attenuation (dB) = A(f) × L$$
$A(f)$ is attenuation coefficient in $dB$ per meter at frequency $f$
$L$ is length in


### Cat5e
**Given**
$f = 100MHz$ or $100,000,000Hz$
$A(f) = 24dB$ for 100MHz Cat5e

**Calculation**
$Attenuation = A(f) × L$ 
$Attenuation = 24dB × 1$ 
$Attenuation = 24dB$

The attenuation coefficient is already commonly known for Cat5e, but for a therough explanation on how its calculated see Attenuation Coeefficient tag
