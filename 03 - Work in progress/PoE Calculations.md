# Attenuation
The reduction in signal strength over a distance
$$ Attenuation (dB) = A(f) × L$$
$A(f)$ is attenuation coefficient in $dB$ per meter at frequency $f$
$L$ is length in


**Cat5e**
We know frequency for Cat5e is 100MHz
$$Attenuation (dB) = A(f) × L = 24dB(for 100 MHz, Cat5e) × 1 = 24dB$$

## Attenuation Coefficient
Unless given the attenuation coefficient, the
