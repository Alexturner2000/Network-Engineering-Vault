# Current
tags: [[Electrical]], [[DC]]

Current is the flow of electrons in a circuit. Conductive materials are a really good at carrying current because of the manipulation of outer valence electrons on conductors. For example, copper, which has a loosely bound electron in their outer valence shell, which is free to move around inside the metal. It moves super easy and in all directions.

To use this, we need lots of electrons to flow in the same direction in a circuit. We can do this by applying a voltage. Its the pushing force in a circuit. The more voltage, the more the electrons can flow.

AMPS = A is the maximum current a circuit can have.

AC (alternating current)
DC (direct current)

We transport current in our power infrastructure using AC. This is because it can be transported very efficiently and over great distance compared to DC. We can also change voltage using transformers.

you can use an inverter to change between AC and DC
